**Rossoforge.UI.Controls** is a Unity package that provides a collection of extensible UI controls (buttons, toggles, sliders, input fields, dropdowns, switches, etc.).
It includes a strongly-typed, centralized event system, designed so a single listener (menu, popup, or container) can handle the logic without directly depending on the internal UI components.
Perfect for projects looking for:
* Consistent and easy-to-extend UI controls.
* A decoupled architecture between UI and business logic.

#
**Version:** Unity 6 or higher

**Tutorial:** [Pending...]

**Dependencies:**
* Unity.TextMeshPro
* [Rossoforge-Extensions](https://github.com/rossogames/Rossoforge-Extensions.git)

#
#This package is part of the **Rossoforge** suite, designed to streamline and enhance Unity development workflows.
